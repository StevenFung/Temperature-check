# Temperature-check

	Use Google Map API and calls in Android. We are allowed to 
input a city’s name such as “Boston, MA’ or by just input “Boston”.
Once we input the city’s name, the app will display the current 
temperature of the city, the image of current weather (rain, storm,
etc.) and Google map will center the specified city we input.
